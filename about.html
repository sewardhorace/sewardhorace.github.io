        <h4>Hi</h4>
        <div class="preformatted">
     The two things I like most are learning things and making things.  To see some things I've had fun making, check out some of my <a href="art.html">OTHER PROJECTS</a> (or just keep looking at this site, for example).  Here are a few things I enjoy learning:<ul><li>How computers and the internet work</li><li>Languages, like Spanish, French, and Japanese</li><li>The best ways to cook chili</li><li>Tango</li><li>Bouldering</li><li>How to play musical instruments, like guitar and banjo</li><li>How to solve pretty much any problem</li><li>Etc.</li></ul>
     It's unfortunate that I only recently started learning about computers.  I used to yell at them and wrestle with them and think they were leading humanity down a dark path to a dystopian future.  That's all pretty much still true, but they're a lot of fun and I'm going to continue learning as much as I can about them.  I'd like to work somewhere I can learn and make things and solve problems on computers.

     Additionally:<ul><li>D&D edition: 5th</li><li>Spanish painter: Goya</li><li>Discworld novel: <em>Guards! Guards!</em></li><li>N64 Game: Star Fox 64</li><li>Food truck order: lamb gyro</li><li>Supervillain: Dr.Doom</li><li>Miyazaki film: Princess Mononoke</li></ul>
