I am faker than a plastic rake cracked by autumn cold 
faker than all plastic 
faker than the industrial age 
faker than a cardboard fast-food crown 
faker than a bleary-eyed drunken smile 
faker than a hardwood floor 
faker than whole-wheat pancake mix
faker than a chicken nugget 
faker than an ad for cologne. 
I am the fakest motherfucker 
     since the moss mountain shed its green
          and became a bald rock face of lies and crumbling.
 I am the backdrop that flies in for the broadway showstopper,
      drawn by a kindergarten class after naptime. 
I am a leopard print dress in line for the club. 
I am salt and hotsauce. 
I am fingerless gloves in mild weather. 
I am deep lines on the forehead of
      a sixty five year old tea guru. 
I am the cameraman behind the endzone.
 I am a blackboard eraser never washed.
 I am the plunger on the cartoon TNT box. 
My stomach is the heaviest thing.
 My feet are sandstone sculptures, 
My hands are poison ivy.
 My arms are rusted railroad spikes.
 My chest is a paper bag filled with splinters. 
My face is wild horses running in the street.
 My legs are a paper airplane.
 I am faker than Mt. Olympus. 
I am in a fluorescent stupor,
      still drowsy upon waking. 
My eyes are sauteed in the ocean. 
I crouch, waiting for the sunset. 
In my sleep I will leap into the atmosphere with a flat rate box 
     and I will gather space dust 
          and I will become irradiated.
 My cosmic powers are infinite and I am wiser than dreamtime legends.
 I am faker than moss mountain unfurling her loom legs and weaving me a blanket
      from the dusk dust. 
Her dog curls beneath her low loom music. 
The dog is uncertain, insubstantial.
 He barks on 2 and 4 and I am pleased. 
I mail him my box for a low low price
      but he has no blade to open it
           and so uses it to weigh down his doctoral thesis
                on incidental mass
                     which will never be published 
                         or even read.

      <div class="preformatted"><h4>Blue Sky Blood</h4>
dead leaves degrade,
 shrivel like the eye sockets of a cow corpse out to pasture,
 crumble and flake between dirt. 
My beard of dead leaves drips with sky blood,
 the thick syrup of starlight and space, azure with dream pollution, 
which at once delays and insures my own slow decay.
 I wore wide-brimmed hats to catch the drops like rain
 but I don't like the way I look in hats
 so my eyes will forever flick skyward
and watch the dawn of each day 
soak into my beard
 as the skin of my face shrinks and swells like leather.

Your jaw is more angular than your glasses
 you speak thin-lipped at the room for twenty-six unbroken minutes
 "establish a rapport," and, "allow yourself to stray from the priority questions."
 I cannot see into their heads or my own - only the outside.
 I want to go out 
If I leave I do not want to go anywhere
 sit in a different room with no walls where everyone is saying
 nothing. no,
 someone is saying 
everything. no, 
nobody is saying 
everything. no, 
nobody is saying 
something. no,
 anybody is saying 
something and I am writing and 
I am listening and I am anybody

On a nightwalk 
alone 
to her I have spoke the ultimate thursday 
"Your knuckles crack like an avalanche, 
your shirt is piano keys and it is buildings."
 have a fever and bite granite fingernails
 walk through ink puddles without ripples
 GONE TO EAT THE SUN
 BACK IN 15 MINS.

      <div class="preformatted"><h4>Jan 16</h4>
This is a strange day.  I yawn and fleas run down my chin.  I perpetually have the feeling of a full bladder and an empty stomach.  My skin is falling off in continent-sized chunks.  I speak Japanese like a snail, whorling in my beige shell.  I present tense moments of abstract
      none sense:
 Doubt crawls dying and bleeding across the floor of the classroom.  Students scooch their chairs away to avoid his wavering grasps.  Gasping silently, he puckers his lips to suck in air.  An eyeball rolls out of his face and bounces twice on the linoleum.
      "Clean this up."
 There are no janitors employed here qualified to clean up this self-reflective leaking pile.  Greasy and grey, stains too tough for hand soap and paper towels tear like tissue.
 A thick torrent of seawater explodes into the room through the door gape, ruining electronic equipment and costing the school thousands.  I smell the salt and I am reminded
     of my grandfather, sitting pale in his soft chair, his soft chest heaving with effort, body laced with plaque and other substances that meet well with the tongue.  He watches westerns until they are all the same, sometimes with the sound off.  Hands folded over his stomach and a subtle scowl that his complacent eyes cover like a white sheet.
      Dastardly thoughts whip me back into the room, where pencils are shouting graphite in a mob.  Reins crack and teeth are gnashing in the mouths of these sleeping young horses.  Nine times the base weight of lead, the heaviest yet, aluminum in its texture, denial hovers over heads like a guillotine, softly whispering to plugged ears, and downcast eyes
     could never catch a glimpse.  I think for a moment about flipping a chair, so some upturned heads could glance beyond their blinders.  But their heads are wrapped in DNA spliced from cigarette butts on damp asphalt and shiny plastic shoes squeaking cleanly against piled skulls in the graveyard down the block.  Ivy weaves through the body, pleasantly obscuring.
      It has been cloudy for weeks.
