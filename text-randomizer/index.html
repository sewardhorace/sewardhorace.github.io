          <h2>Features</h2>
          <p>
            Text Randomizer converts a spreadsheet into a customizable random text generator suitable for use with tabletop role-playing games.
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/BS37ReJ.png" title="screenshot" />
            Compose random words, phrases, numbers, and names to generate more complex text - for example, detailed characters, objects, foes, locations, or anything you need to add a spark of unpredictability and spontaneity to your game sessions.  Build your generators using simple syntax, then generate results with the click of a button. Includes the option to generate random names and words to match the flavor of your campaign.
            <br><br>
            A usage reference is included in the menu, as well as example data to get started. Text Randomizer is completely free.
          </p>

        <div>
          <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
          <p>
            The Text Randomizer add-on requires access to the active spreadsheet only. Data in the active spreadsheet is used only to define names and options for randomized text generators that are made accessible to the user in the sidebar interface. No additional user data is accessed, collected, stored, used, or shared in any way. The services that invoke authorizations from the user are the Spreadsheet service (allows the app to read data from the active spreadsheet to generate randomized text and insert required sheets and example data into the active spreadsheet) and the Ui service (allows the app to display the sidebar interface and user reference dialog window).
          </p>

          <h2>Usage Reference</h2>
          Text Randomizer converts a spreadsheet into a customizable random text generator.
          <br>
          <br>
          There are four main tools for generating random text: making a <b>random selection</b>, generating a <b>random number</b>, making a <b>one-time selection</b>, 
          and assigning random results to a <b>variable</b>.  Each utilizes curly braces <b>{ }</b> (note that curly braces <b>{ }</b> should never be placed inside another set of curly braces.)
          <br>
          <br>
          Any number of sheets may be used, but two special sheet names are reserved - <b>Endpoints</b> and <b>Names</b>. These are discussed below.
          <br>
          <br>
          <hr>
          <br>
          Use column headers to define a label for a <b>random selection</b> of possible options. Labels should be written without spaces. For example: "rare_gem"
          <br>
          Use the rows beneath a given label to define the possible options for that label:
          <br>
          <br>
          <table>
            <tr>
              <th><b>rare_gem</b></th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>diamond</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>ruby</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>black opal</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>sapphire</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>moonstone</td>
            </tr>
          </table>
          <br>
          Once a <b>random selection</b> has been defined, it can be used in other options by surrounding the label with curly braces <b>{ }</b>
          <br>
          <br>
          <table>
            <tr>
              <th>rare_gem</th>
              <th>treasure</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>diamond</td>
              <td>a magic ring</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>ruby</td>
              <td>a sparkling <b>{rare_gem}</b></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>black opal</td>
              <td></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>sapphire</td>
              <td></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>moonstone</td>
              <td></td>
            </tr>
          </table>
          <br>
          Use a pound <b>#</b> character to generate a <b>random number</b>. The minimum and maximum possible values are separated by a dash <b>-</b> . 
          Note that negative numbers cannot be generated (as a workaround, simply place a "-" sign before the curly brackets).
          <br>
          <br>
          <table>
            <tr>
              <th>rare_gem</th>
              <th>treasure</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>diamond</td>
              <td>a magic ring</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>ruby</td>
              <td>a sparkling {rare_gem}</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>black opal</td>
              <td><b>{#100-300}</b> silver coins</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>sapphire</td>
              <td></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>moonstone</td>
              <td></td>
            </tr>
          </table>
          <br>
          Define a <b>one-time selection</b> by placing a list of options inside square braces <b>[ ]</b> separated by vertical bars <b>|</b> . 
          This is useful for situations where defining a whole column of options would be overkill.
          <br>
          <br>
          <table>
            <tr>
              <th>rare_gem</th>
              <th>treasure</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>diamond</td>
              <td>a magic ring</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>ruby</td>
              <td>a sparkling {rare_gem}</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>black opal</td>
              <td>{#100-300} <b>{[grubby copper|silver|gold]}</b> coins</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>sapphire</td>
              <td></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>moonstone</td>
              <td></td>
            </tr>
          </table>
          <br>
          Lastly, define a <b>variable</b> using the at <b>@</b> character. The first time a variable is used it must be assigned a value by following it with a colon <b>:</b> 
          and any of the generator options defined above - a <b>random selection</b> label, a <b>random number</b>, or a <b>one-time selection</b>. Then the randomly assigned value can be reused by referencing the variable name. 
          Variable names cannot have spaces.
          <br>
          <br>
          <table>
            <tr>
              <th>rare_gem</th>
              <th>treasure</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>diamond</td>
              <td>a magic ring</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>ruby</td>
              <td>a sparkling {rare_gem}</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>black opal</td>
              <td>{#200-300} {[grubby copper|silver|gold]} coins</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>sapphire</td>
              <td>a crown with a small <b>{@crown_gem:rare_gem}</b> on each point, and a huge <b>{@crown_gem}</b> in the center</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>moonstone</td>
              <td></td>
            </tr>
          </table>
          <br>
          There are two special Sheets that Text Randomizer treats differently - <b>Endpoints</b> and <b>Names</b>.
          <br>
          <br>
          <hr>
          <br>
          A sheet named <b>Endpoints</b> is required. It is where the top-level random generators are defined which will appear as buttons 
           in the Text Randomizer interface. 
          Using the example labels above, the following example endpoints might be defined:
          <br>
          <br>
          <table>
            <tr>
              <th>Single Treasure</th>
              <th>Treasure Hoard</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>{treasure}</td>
              <td>{treasure}, </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td></td>
              <td>{treasure}, </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td></td>
              <td>and {treasure}</td>
            </tr>
          </table>
          <br>
          When the Text Randomizer interface is opened, two buttons will be present - a button for "Single Treasure", which generates a single random treasure, and a button for "Treasure Hoard", which generates three random treasures. 
          The <b>Endpoints</b> sheet has a couple of key usage differences:
          <ol>
            <li>The headers, which will determine the button names in the interface, can have spaces and punctuation.</li>
            <li>Multiple rows are used to generate a multi-line result, not to provide multiple possible options.</li>
          </ol>
          <br>
          <hr>
          <br>
          Inclusion of a sheet called <b>Names</b> is optional. Use the <b>Names</b> sheet to randomly generate new words or names. 
          As in a regular sheet, each column header defines a label that can be used in curly braces <b>{ }</b> to produce a randomized result. 
          However, the rows below the header consist of sample names that will be 
          used to generate new names, rather than a list of predefined options. For example:
          <br>
          <br>
          <table>
            <tr>
              <th>sword_name</th>
              <th>monster_name</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>excalibur</td>
              <td>balrog</td>

          Be aware that name generator results are dependent on the quality and quantity of sample names provided. 
          A minimum of 30 sample names is suggested, and 100 or more are recommended for best results. 
          If too few samples are provided, it is possible that the generator may produce results identical to the samples names.
