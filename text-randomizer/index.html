          <h2>Features</h2>
          <p>
            Text Randomizer converts a spreadsheet into a customizable random text generator suitable for use with tabletop role-playing games.
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/BS37ReJ.png" title="screenshot" />
            Compose random words, phrases, numbers, and names to generate more complex text - for example, detailed characters, objects, foes, locations, or anything you need to add a spark of unpredictability and spontaneity to your game sessions.  Build your generators using simple syntax, then generate results with the click of a button. Includes the option to generate random names and words to match the flavor of your campaign.
            <br><br>
            A usage reference is included, as well as example data to get started. Text Randomizer is completely free.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
          <p>
            The Text Randomizer add-on requires access to the active spreadsheet only. There is no collection of user data. The services that invokes authorizations from the user are the Spreadsheet service (reads data from the active spreadsheet to generate randomized text, inserts required sheets and example data into the active spreadsheet) and the Ui service (displays sidebar interface and user reference dialog window).
          </p>
